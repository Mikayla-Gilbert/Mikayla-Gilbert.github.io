### CPSC 120

* Lab 8
    Lab 8 part 2 was a favorite that I worked on as I found it fun to create a pattern. 
    It was interesting to use loops as a way to create a unique pattern and not make it
    so you have to manually enter each line of a pattern. It was very nice to see the 
    importance of efficient code and it not always being super lengthy.

* Lab 6
    For lab 6, part 2, I really enjoyed exploring the aspect of Blackjack as before this 
    assignment I was very new to blackjack. Seeing the code and trying to understand it 
    was fun to learn. I learned both code knowledge and blackjack! 

* Lab 10
    Lab 10 had just one part but still had a big challenge. It was very interesting to try 
    pulling info from a different file and working with rows. Pulling the population numbers 
    and calling different things was very fun and interesting.
